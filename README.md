### Hello there 👋

My name is Catherine Dischinger and I'm proud to be working as a Software Engineer. I started my career as a Bookkeeper / Office Manager and stumbled across computer programming at one of my Bookkeeping jobs. It was ❤️ at first sight. Convinced that software engineering was the right career for me, I dropped down to 30 hours a week at my job and started taking Computer Science classes at night. 2️ years later I 👩‍🎓 from Boston University with a BS in Computer Science and started my first job as a Software Engineer. I haven't looked back since!
